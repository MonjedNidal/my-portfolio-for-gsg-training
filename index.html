        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Fourth-year computer science student is passionate about front-end
          development. Has a high ability to learn new technologies and
          accomplished numerous courses from the basics of HTML to advanced
          JavaScript topics, which allowed me to learn ReactJS. I have practiced
          React by building more than 15 projects from A to Z. Styled with
          vanilla CSS or frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS, and I'm
          looking forward to improving my skills and experience.

        <h2>Why I'm Applying</h2>
        <p>
          I'm really excited about this program because I see it as a chance to
          learn by doing. Working alongside experienced developers and being
          part of real projects is exactly the kind of environment I’ve been
          looking for to grow my skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m also hoping this experience will help me build confidence, improve
          the way I approach challenges, and prepare me for a future career in
          web development. It feels like the right step forward.
